# Idle Clicker

This is a basic game that I coded mainly for helping improve my Javascript skills.

The game works by having the user click a button to earn points, initially 1 point per click.
Once enough points are accumulated, the user can upgrade their click power(the amount of points they get per click) or they can purchase an autoclicker, which automatically earns them points.
